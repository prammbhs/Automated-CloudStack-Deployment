# Automated-CloudStack-Deployment
This project contains a Bash automation script that fully sets up an Apache CloudStack 4.20 environment with a KVM hypervisor on a single Ubuntu 20.04 machine. It configures the management server, MySQL, system VM templates, NFS storage, and agent setupâ€”all in one go.
